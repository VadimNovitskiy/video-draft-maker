    <div class="text">Everybody’s “in the cloud” right? So why are only 10% of <span #selected class="selected">companies</span> reaping the full benefits -- like revenue growth, new revenue streams, improved profitability and better decision making? These standouts are what we call <span #selected class="selected">cloud-powered</span> companies and they’re getting cloud RIGHT. But how are they doing it? And how can you do it too? PwC's 2023 Cloud Business Survey is here, and it reveals that a staggering 80% of executives are not yet prioritizing Industry Cloud, failing to unlock greater <span #selected class="selected">business</span> value -- and falling behind. Industry Cloud can help you stay ahead of the curve — achieving cloud success faster, and often with significantly fewer barriers to transformation. A winning cloud strategy isn’t typically one-size-fits-all, and our industry-leading knowledge across business sectors can help take your cloud transformation to the next level and deliver sustainable value from your investments.</div>
